# Probe a Kimply deployment's readiness endpoint with retry and backoff.
#
# Used by deploy/deploy.sh (EC2) and deploy/ecs-deploy.sh (ECS) to gate a
# release, and runnable by hand to check a
# live deployment. Hitting the PUBLIC URL is the point: it exercises DNS, the
# Elastic IP, the security group, nginx, TLS, the app and MongoDB in one call, so
# a pass means the whole path works rather than just the container.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/health-check.sh https://kimply.example.com
#   ./scripts/health-check.sh https://localhost --insecure   # self-signed cert
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  ready
#   1  did not become ready within the retry budget
#   2  usage error
