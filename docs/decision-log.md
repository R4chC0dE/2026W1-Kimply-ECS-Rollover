# Decision log

Every substantive change to Kimply, newest first.
One entry per change: what changed, which files, and any consequence that is not obvious from the diff.

This was the "Feature Log" section of `AGENTS.md` until 2026-08-29.
It moved out so that `AGENTS.md` stays a description of how the system is *now*, while the record of how it got that way can grow here without pushing the inventory tables further down a file every agent reads in full.

`AGENTS.md` remains the source of truth for the current state: collections, publications, methods, routes, tests, defects.
This file is the source of truth for **why** any of that is the way it is.

## Adding an entry

- Newest entry goes directly below this section, above the previous one.
- Heading is `## YYYY-MM-DD - <what changed>`.
- Record the consequence that is not obvious from the diff. If reading the diff would tell you, leave it out.
- Name the files that moved.
- Write it in the same change that alters the behaviour, not afterwards.
- Never rewrite an older entry. If it turned out to be wrong, say so in the new one.

## 2026-09-22 - Production target moves to ECS on Fargate, with Terraform for the infrastructure

The production design for replacing the single EC2 instance was worked out and recorded in `docs/ecs-target-architecture.md` (decisions D1-D39), and the Terraform to build it now exists under `infra/terraform/`.
Nothing has been applied yet, and the EC2 stack is still what serves `kimply.online`.

Things that are not obvious from the diff:

- **The ALB health check is `/health/live`, not `/health/ready`.**
  In ECS a failing load balancer check also replaces the task, so a Mongo-dependent check would restart every task in a loop through an Atlas outage.
  `/health/ready` moves to the external canary, which can roll a deploy back but can never restart a task.
- **The canonical host becomes `www.kimply.online`.**
  DNS stays at GoDaddy, which cannot alias the apex to a load balancer, so GoDaddy forwards the apex to `www` and `ROOT_URL` changes with it.
- **The task definition template is shared by Terraform and the pipeline.**
  Terraform renders it once for the first revision and then ignores the service's revision, so an apply never undoes a deploy.
  Because the template hard-codes names and ARNs, preconditions fail the plan if it and the infrastructure drift apart.
- **Until cutover the stack serves `ecs.kimply.online`, against the live database.**
  The EC2 stack keeps `kimply.online` and `www` untouched, so nothing about production DNS changes until the ECS stack has been played on.
  The certificate covers `www` from the start so cutover does not wait on validation.
  GoDaddy forwarding was tested first: it serves HTTPS but drops paths and query strings, so after cutover apex deep links land on a GoDaddy 404.
- **The secret is referenced by its full ARN, random suffix and all.**
  The first deploy referenced it by name, and ECS read that as an SSM Parameter Store parameter and failed with `ssm:GetParameters` denied.
  A precondition now fails the plan if the template's `valueFrom` is not the secret's ARN.
- **The polling interval drops to 3s through `METEOR_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`, with no code change.**
  Atlas M0 has no oplog, so with two tasks a write on one only reaches the other's subscribers at its next poll.
- **Four application issues surfaced that matter more with two tasks**, recorded as I1-I4 in the architecture document rather than fixed here.
  The most serious is that an in-game DDP reconnect may never re-bind `connectionId`, so a player who reconnects could be removed after the 15s grace window.
  It needs an end-to-end reproduction before it goes in the defect register.

- **Development reuses the same module and borrows production's NAT gateway.**
  `envs/dev` differs from `envs/prod` only in values: `FARGATE_SPOT`, 1-2 tasks, its own cluster, ECR repository, secret, log group and domain (`ecs-dev.kimply.online`).
  A second NAT gateway would have cost more than the whole dev environment, so dev routes through production's and reads its ID from production's Terraform state.
  That is the one resource the environments share, and the cost is a real coupling: replacing production's NAT cuts dev off from its database until dev is re-applied.
- **The pipeline deploys only to ECS. The SSM path is gone.**
  Keeping both targets would have kept the EC2 stacks in step until cutover, at the cost of a workflow that had to reason about two deployment systems.
  The consequence is accepted deliberately: `kimply.online` and `dev.kimply.online` now lag their branches until each cutover, and shipping to one in the meantime means running `deploy/deploy.sh` on that instance by hand.
- **The deploy workflow resolves every branch-specific value in one `config` job.**
  A `case` on the branch name maps it to the ECR repository, roles, cluster, service, task definition template, smoke-test URL and EC2 target, and an unrecognised branch fails there.
  The previous `github.ref_name == 'main' && ... || ...` expressions treated every non-main branch as development, which would have silently pointed a future `staging` branch at the dev stack.
- **GitHub roles trust exact OIDC subject prefixes, not repository names.**
  The first pipeline run from the fork failed to assume `GitHubActionsECRPush` because the fork uses GitHub's immutable subject format, `repo:owner@<id>/name@<id>`, while the upstream repository still sends `repo:owner/name`.
  `StringEquals` needs the exact string, so each repository is listed by the prefix GitHub reports for it.
- **During the parallel run, `main` deploys to both production stacks.**
  The deploy workflow is split into build, ECS and EC2 jobs so `kimply.online` and `ecs.kimply.online` always run the same image.
  `deploy/ecs-deploy.sh` waits on the outcome of its own deployment ID rather than `aws ecs wait services-stable`, because after a circuit-breaker rollback the service is stable again on the old revision and that waiter would report success.

## 2026-09-04 - The Quality Assurance Plan is now a document in the repo

The QA plan existed only as a submission document, written before most of the machinery it described was built.
It claimed an agile-subteam branch model the repo no longer uses, quoted performance targets that had never been measured, and described security in terms the defect register contradicts.

It now lives at `docs/quality-assurance-plan-submission.md`, and every claim in it is either sourced from the codebase or marked as an unmet target.

Three things that are not obvious from the diff:

- **Unmet requirements are stated as unmet, with the measurement.**
  The "under 0.5s response" performance NFR is marked not met and carries the real numbers from the load test runs: the sequence submission method at a median of roughly 1.1s locally and 4.4s against dev at 100 players.
  The plan is more useful as an accurate account of where we are than as a list of things we would like to be true.
- **The security section is written against the defect register rather than around it.**
  The outstanding identity and hashing defects appear in the plan with the explicit statement that the fix for the first is connection binding and not a login wall, so a future reader cannot use the QA plan as justification for auth-gating the game.
- **The plan ends with its own gap list.**
  It names what it does not yet cover, including the coverage smoke gate, the formatting gate that cannot yet run in CI, and the absent end-to-end test, so the next milestone closes them deliberately instead of rediscovering them.

Files: `docs/quality-assurance-plan-submission.md` (new), `AGENTS.md`.

## 2026-09-01 - The game screen now scales to the viewport instead of overflowing it (D19)

The play column was sized in fixed pixels and `vw`, so it stayed about 740px tall on every screen while the container was pinned to `100dvh` with `overflow: hidden`. Starting the turn added two rows (the message and the `Time left` line, which only existed while input was open), pushed the button row past the fold, and the buttons were clipped with no way to scroll to them. On a full-height 1512x828 laptop there were 7px to spare before the turn started, which is why it read as a mobile bug.

Hearts, the tile grid, the button row and the header padding now scale with `dvh`, the column's rhythm moved from `vh` to `dvh` so it matches the container's own `100dvh`, and the timer row is always rendered so the buttons do not move when the sequence ends.

Two things that are not obvious from the diff:

- **The scroll fallback had to move off the container.** Putting `overflow-y: auto` on the container looked right and was wrong: `TileLattice` is deliberately larger than the screen (1100px tall, offset above the fold), so the container became scrollable by 188px of pure decoration - D18's empty-strip symptom arriving by another route. The container keeps `overflow: hidden` and the fallback sits on the play column, which contains only real content.
- **`dvh` is what makes this hold on mobile.** The column's margins were `vh`, which on mobile resolves to the largest viewport (toolbar hidden) while the container is `100dvh` (toolbar shown). The column was therefore budgeting against a taller box than it actually had.

Files: `app/imports/ui/pages/GamePage.jsx`, `app/imports/ui/ColourSequence.jsx`, `docs/defect-register.md` (D19), `AGENTS.md`.

Verified end to end in Chrome at 13 viewports from 320x568 to 1920x1080, and in a real 420x583 window: the button row is fully visible in both the watching and the input phase, at the same position in each, and nothing scrolls.

## 2026-08-31 - Game page uses 100dvh so it stops scrolling into empty space (D18)

The gameplay container used `minHeight: 100vh`. On mobile `100vh` is the largest viewport (address bar hidden), so the container was taller than the visible screen and left an empty strip to scroll into. Switched it to `100dvh`, which tracks the visible area as browser chrome shows/hides. `overflowY: 'auto'` stays, so genuine overflow on short screens still scrolls.
Files: `app/imports/ui/pages/GamePage.jsx`, `docs/defect-register.md` (D18).
## 2026-08-31 - Lives display now shows the full starting-lives track (D17)

The game page sized its hearts off `Math.max(player.lives, 3)` and computed `totalLives` only for `gameMode === 'custom'`, so preset modes (easy = 5 lives, etc.) fell back to 3 and a lost life removed a heart instead of greying it out.
`customSettings.startingLives` is populated for every preset, so `totalLives` now reads it regardless of mode and the display renders a fixed `totalLives` track, greying circles above the current life count. `players.join` already stores the correct starting lives, so this was display-only.
Files: `app/imports/ui/pages/GamePage.jsx`, `docs/defect-register.md` (D17).
## 2026-08-31 - Locked tile input during the post-mistake sequence replay (D16)

After a wrong guess with lives remaining, `GamePage.handleSubmit` set `playerCanInput` to `true` and bumped `replayKey` in the same breath, so the colour tiles stayed clickable while the sequence replayed and a player could copy the answer as each tile lit up.
Set `playerCanInput` to `false` on the retry path and let `onSequenceComplete` re-enable it after the replay, matching the fresh-round flow. Non-obvious: the retry replay reuses the same `roundId`, so re-enabling has to be driven by the replay finishing, not by a round change.
Files: `app/imports/ui/pages/GamePage.jsx`, `docs/defect-register.md` (D16).
## 2026-08-31 - Fixed the room-code input dropping keystrokes (D15)

`JoinRoom.handleInput` passed a functional updater to `setCode` that read `e.target.value`, then cleared that same value synchronously with `clearCapturedInput(e)` further down the handler.
React only evaluates a functional updater eagerly when the fiber has no pending work; otherwise it defers the updater until render, by which point the clear has already blanked `e.target.value`, so `appendRoomCodeInput` received `''` and the keystroke was lost. That is why players had to type each code letter twice.
The fix reads the typed value into a local before clearing and references that local inside the updater, so the update no longer depends on the mutated DOM node. The non-obvious part: reordering `clearCapturedInput` above `setCode` is not cosmetic — it removes a read-after-mutate race, not just a style preference.

## 2026-08-29 - Skills are workflows, not product rules

Every skill under `.agents/skills/` was rewritten to drop game-specific rules (defect IDs, publication invariants, route tables, "do not add a login wall", lives / sequences / `'demo'` gameId).
Those belong in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/`. Skills now only say how to run git, tests, Docker, Meteor, and the rest of the toolchain, and they point at the docs when a change would move an invariant.
Files: all ten `SKILL.md` files, `AGENTS.md` skills table.

## 2026-08-29 - The design system gets its own document, and AGENTS.md becomes a hub

`docs/design_system.md` (v0.1, design-authored) is now the source of truth for colour, typography, spacing, radii, elevation, motion, component specs, patterns, and voice.
`AGENTS.md` points at it instead of carrying a four-row token table.
Files: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/defect-register.md`, `.agents/skills/ui/SKILL.md`, `.agents/skills/review/SKILL.md`.

The wider change is a rule about what `AGENTS.md` is for. It is the inventory of the running system - collections, publications, methods, routes, invariants - and nothing else.
Where another file already holds the bulk, it now keeps only what a reviewer needs at a glance and links to the home file. A "Where things live" table near the top names every home.
Design system, development commands, testing prose, deployment prose, and defect detail were trimmed on that basis; the data model, publication, method, and route tables were not touched, because nothing else holds them.

Two pieces of drift surfaced while doing it, both of which had made a reference unsafe to follow:

- **`design.jsx` disagrees with the design system.** `SURFACE` is `oklch(0.18 …)` against the documented `0.20`, `FG` and `FG3` also differ, and `DANGER` / `ACCENT` are not in the document at all. `tailwind.config.js` matches the document exactly, which is why the `ui` skill now says to prefer the Tailwind class wherever both exist. The code was left alone deliberately: changing `SURFACE` moves every card on every screen, and that is a design call, not a cleanup.
- **The defect IDs in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/defect-register.md` had drifted by one.** The register had D12 for the root lockfile and D13 for the `AudioContext` leak, where the summary table had D11 and D12, and D14 existed only in the summary table. Since the register's own header states that its IDs match the summary table, the register was reconciled onto that numbering: two headings renumbered, a real D14 section written, and D9 / D10 marked fixed there rather than only in `AGENTS.md`. **There is no D13**, and the gap is documented so nobody closes it - the IDs are cited from skills and pull requests.

## 2026-08-29 - Stack specialist skills, and this log leaves AGENTS.md

Six skills added under `.agents/skills/`, joining `git`, `test`, `ui`, and `review`: `meteor`, `react`, `mongo`, `docker`, `deploy`, `debug`.
`.claude/skills` and `.cursor/skills` are directory symlinks to `.agents/skills`, so nothing was copied into a vendor folder.
Files: new `.agents/skills/{meteor,react,mongo,docker,deploy,debug}/SKILL.md`; `AGENTS.md`; new `docs/decision-log.md`; `.agents/skills/review/SKILL.md`.

The split is deliberate. The four original skills answer *what to do* (cut a branch, write a test, style a screen, review a diff). The six new ones answer *how this stack actually behaves*, which is the knowledge an agent otherwise reconstructs badly from general Meteor or React habits.

Five things the skills now record that the `AGENTS.md` tables did not, each of which has already caused a real bug or would have:

- **`useSubscribe` returns a function, not a boolean.** `!isLoading` negates a function and is always false. That is what made the dead `useEffect` in `PlayerLobby` dead, and it sat there long enough to become D9.
- **Three different subscription styles coexist** - inside `useTracker` gated on `ready()` (`Leaderboard.jsx`), `useSubscribe` (`PlayerLobby.jsx`), and `Meteor.subscribe` in a `useEffect` with a manual `stop()` (`GamePage.jsx`). All three are correct; picking one at random per component is how a subscription leak gets written.
- **CI runs `meteor test --once --full-app`, but `npm test` does not pass `--full-app`.** The `global._<x>Initialized` guards are therefore load-bearing in CI only: delete one and it passes locally, then fails the PR.
- **Methods are registered behind `Meteor.isServer`, so no client stub exists and there is no latency compensation.** Every call is a full round trip and the component owns its own pending state. Optimistic UI written against an imagined stub would never run.
- **Minimongo stays synchronous while the server is async-only.** `findOne()` inside `useTracker` is correct and `findOneAsync` there is wrong, which is the opposite of the rule that holds three directories away in `imports/api/`.

Two inconsistencies surfaced while checking the source, both left alone as out of scope:

- `app/Dockerfile`'s header comment still says `t4g.medium`. The instances are `t4g.small`, as corrected in the 2026-08-21 entry below.
- `app/Dockerfile` now overwrites `web.browser.legacy` with a copy of `web.browser`, because Meteor serves the ES5 legacy bundle to any user agent its `modern-browsers` package cannot identify (Facebook Messenger's iOS in-app browser is one) and that bundle was missing app code, giving those users a blank screen. That fix is recorded only in a comment in the Dockerfile; it has no entry in this log.

## 2026-08-29 - Agent-agnostic skills; AGENTS.md is the single instruction file
`AGENTS.md` is now the canonical always-on file. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, so Claude Code and every other agent read the same inventory.
Skills live once under `.agents/skills/` (`git`, `test`, `ui`, `review`). `.claude/skills` and `.cursor/skills` are directory symlinks to that folder — do not copy skills into a vendor directory.
Removed the Claude-only memory-file protocol (those files were never in the repo). `.gitignore` no longer ignores all of `.claude/`, only `settings.local.json` and `worktrees/`.
Tables refreshed against `dev`: live leaderboard subscribes to `players` + `rounds` (not the `leaderboard` pub), `publications.test.js` and `leaderboardModel.test.js` exist, `GamePage` has no `'demo'` gameId.

## 2026-08-24 - Custom flash speed choices

The custom game settings page offers Fast, Med and Slow flash-speed choices, mapped to 200 ms, 500 ms and 1000 ms. The existing numeric `flashSpeed` setting passed through navigation is unchanged.

Carried over from the Feature Log in `CLAUDE.md` on `battle-royale-status-ui-trisha`, which became a symlink to `AGENTS.md` when that branch merged `dev`. The entry would otherwise have been lost with the file.

## 2026-08-21 - A development environment that mirrors production, deployed from `dev`
`dev.kimply.online` is now a second, fully independent copy of the production stack on its own `t4g.small`, with its own Elastic IP, ECR repository, IAM roles and Atlas cluster.
Files: new `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (replaces `docker-ecr.yml`), new `docs/dev-environment.md`; `deploy/deploy.sh`, `deploy/build-push.sh`, `deploy/init-letsencrypt.sh`, `docs/deployment-manual.md`, `docs/operations.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
Deleted the untracked `.github/workflows/aws_push.yml` (a broken stub with no `id-token: write`, an undefined `AWS_REGION`, a role that does not exist, and a duplicate `main` trigger that would have raced the real pipeline) and `rendered.conf` (an envsubst debug artifact).

Not a line of `deploy/`, `nginx/` or `docker-compose.prod.yml` needed to change to support a second environment, which is the strongest evidence that the `.env`-driven design was right.

Seven things worth carrying forward:

- **The OIDC roles are per-branch, and that is deliberate.** GitHub's subject claim is `repo:<org>/<repo>:ref:refs/heads/<branch>`, so the existing production roles simply refused a `dev` workflow. Widening them to accept both refs was the smaller change and was rejected: separate `...Dev` roles, scoped to `repository/kimply-dev` and the dev instance ARN, make it structurally impossible for a push to `dev` to touch production. The production roles were not modified at all.
- **Separate ECR repositories are required, not tidiness.** `kimply` is `IMMUTABLE`-tagged and keeps only 10 images. Sharing it would let dev builds evict production rollback targets, and because tags are commit SHAs, a fast-forward `dev` to `main` merge would push an already-existing tag and be rejected outright.
- **`${APP_IMAGE}` has no default, so the ECR repository must be seeded before the box is configured.** `docker compose config` fails on an unset image and `deploy.sh` will not run without one. Run `ECR_REPOSITORY=kimply-dev ./deploy/build-push.sh` locally first, rather than discovering this through a failed first pipeline run.
- **`build-push.sh` had lost its buildx attestation flags, and getting that wrong poisons an immutable tag.** Commit `2b7dfa2` added `--provenance=false --sbom=false` because buildx otherwise attaches provenance and SBOM attestations, turning the result into an OCI index that ECR rejects with a bare `400 Bad Request` on the manifest PUT, after every layer has already uploaded. Main's 53-line rewrite of the script dropped them; this change restores them. The trap on top of the trap: the failed push still lands the in-toto provenance manifest **under the tag**, and because both repositories are `IMMUTABLE`, every retry then fails with the same 400 for an entirely different reason. Recovery is `aws ecr batch-delete-image` on the tag first, since immutability blocks overwrite but not delete.
- **The attestation failure is invisible in CI and only bites locally.** GitHub's runners use the classic Docker image store, where `--load` converts to Docker schema2 and the push succeeds, which is why production has been green since 2026-08-14. Docker Desktop with the containerd image store (`io.containerd.snapshotter.v1`) keeps OCI media types through `--load`, so a developer running `build-push.sh` by hand hits it and CI never does.
- **`deploy/deploy.sh` in the repo was NOT what production actually runs, and the repo copy was broken.** The production box carried a fix that no branch has: `set_app_image()` must `export APP_IMAGE="$image"` as well as rewriting `.env`, because **Docker Compose gives the shell environment precedence over `--env-file`**. `deploy.sh` does `set -a; source "$ENV_FILE"`, which exports the OLD `APP_IMAGE`; rewriting only the file then changes nothing, `compose up` decides the service is already current and prints `Container kimply-app Running` instead of `Recreated`, and the deploy silently becomes a no-op. The post-recreate image guard is what turns that into a loud failure instead of a false success, and it is the only reason this was caught. Verified empirically: `APP_IMAGE=STALE/SENTINEL:0000 docker compose --env-file .env config` resolves to the sentinel, not the file. The fix is now committed; before that, running `sync-config.sh` against **production** would have overwritten prod's working script with the broken one and quietly turned every production deploy into a no-op that reported success.
- **Production's health gate is currently vacuous.** `main` has no `app/server/health.js`, so `/health/live` and `/health/ready` both return the Meteor SPA shell with a 200 and both the Docker `HEALTHCHECK` and `deploy.sh`'s probe pass unconditionally. `main` is also missing `server/publications.js` and `server/indexes.js`, so production still runs the unscoped publications of D2. Development, built from `dev`, has all three and a genuinely working gate. This resolves when `dev` reaches `main`, which is a release decision and was left alone.

Three documentation claims were corrected against reality while doing this: the instances are `t4g.small` (2 GB) not `t4g.medium`, the swap file is 2 GB not 4 GB, and `build-push.sh` neither refuses a dirty tree nor boots the image before pushing, despite `deployment-manual.md` saying it does both.

## 2026-08-05 - Production image and proxy validated end to end
The production stack now runs locally and is verified: arm64 image builds, boots in ~7s, and serves through nginx over TLS.

Measured and confirmed rather than assumed:
- **The bundle asks for Node 22.22.0.** The Dockerfile now reads `star.json` at build time and fails the build on a major-version mismatch with the runner, turning the classic "builds fine, dies on boot" failure into a build error.
- **WebSocket upgrade returns `101` through nginx.** Without this, DDP silently falls back to SockJS long-polling: everything still works, but connection count and latency balloon. Always verify the 101, never just that the app loads.
- Image runs as `node` (uid 1000), carries no Meteor CLI, no `.meteor`, no raw source and no secrets in any layer.
- `kimply-app` publishes no host ports (`{"3000/tcp":null}`); only nginx binds 80 and 443.

New: `loadtest/ddp-smoke.mjs` drives real DDP over a WebSocket using Node's built-in `WebSocket`, with no dependencies.
It asserts room creation, reactive lobby updates, scoped `rounds`, **zero leakage for a foreign gameId**, and **no `attemptedSequence`** on any published player document.
This is scriptable in a way a browser test is not, and it is the foundation for the Phase 7 load harness.

One production bug found by running it: the nginx base image ships `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`, and conf.d loads alphabetically, so that stock server block became the **default server for port 80**. Any request with an unmatched Host header - a bare hit on the Elastic IP, a scanner - would have received the nginx welcome page instead of the HTTPS redirect. Fixed by mounting `nginx/disable-default.conf` over it and marking our own listeners `default_server`.

## 2026-08-05 - Production deployment configuration (Nginx, Compose, ECR, runbooks)
Added the full manual-deployment stack for a single arm64 EC2 instance.
Files: rewritten `app/Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`; new `nginx/nginx.conf`, `nginx/templates/kimply.conf.template`, `.env.production.example`, root `.dockerignore`; new `deploy/{bootstrap-ec2,init-letsencrypt,build-push,deploy}.sh`, `scripts/health-check.sh`; new `docs/deployment-manual.md` and `docs/operations.md`.

`docker-compose.yml` (development) is untouched and must stay that way.

Three things the production build taught us, all of which would otherwise have failed on a real deploy:
- **`meteor` is not on PATH after `npm install -g meteor`.** The npm package unpacks the toolchain into `$HOME/.meteor` and symlinks there, adding no shim to the global npm bin. Without `ENV PATH="/root/.meteor:$PATH"` every `meteor` call exits 127.
- **`tests/` must stay in the Docker build context.** `meteor.testModule` in `package.json` points at `tests/main.js`, and `meteor build` resolves that path even for a production build. Excluding it fails with `Could not resolve meteor.mainModule "tests/main.js"`.
- **`npm ci` cannot be used inside the bundle.** Meteor 3.4 emits no lockfile into `programs/server`, so `npm ci` fails with npm's usage dump (easy to misread as a bad flag). Use `npm install --omit=dev`, which is Meteor's documented step.

Other non-obvious decisions:
- Nginx config is a **template**, rendered by the official image's entrypoint. `NGINX_ENVSUBST_FILTER=^DOMAIN$` is load-bearing: without it envsubst also replaces nginx's own `$host`, `$remote_addr` and `$http_upgrade`, silently producing a broken config.
- TLS bootstrap uses a **self-signed placeholder certificate** rather than a second HTTP-only config, so there is one nginx config for every environment and local validation exercises the exact production file.
- **No separate rollback script.** Rollback is `deploy.sh <older-sha>` through the same health-gated path, because a rollback runs during an incident and should not be the least-tested code path.

## 2026-08-04 - Production readiness: scoped publications, health endpoints, indexes
Removed the `RoundsCollection.removeAsync({})` startup wipe that destroyed every in-flight game on each restart (D1), and scoped the three global publications by `gameId` while excluding `attemptedSequence` (D2).
Added `/health/live` and `/health/ready` and 11 MongoDB indexes.
Files: `server/main.js`, new `server/publications.js`, `server/health.js`, `server/indexes.js`; `ui/pages/GamePage.jsx`, `ui/Leaderboard.jsx`, `ui/EndLeaderboard.jsx`; new `tests/publications.test.js`; `package.json`.

Consequences worth knowing:
- **Publications moved out of `server/main.js`.** Plain `meteor test` never loads the server entry point, so publications defined there are untestable. They now live in `server/publications.js` behind a double-eval guard.
- **`GamePage` no longer has a `'demo'` gameId fallback.** With scoped publications a placeholder subscribes to a nonexistent game and hangs on LOADING, so it now renders a "no game selected" screen instead.
- **Readiness caches its Mongo ping for 5 s** so that health polling does not become steady load against the Atlas free tier.
- Verified end to end in a browser: with a second game injected directly into Mongo, the client saw 1 round and 1 player instead of the server's 2 and 9, and no `attemptedSequence` on any document.

Also fixed two defects found while testing: `<HostView>` was missing its `navigate` prop and threw on **every** game start (D10), and a dead `useEffect` sitting after an early return violated the rules of hooks (D9).

## 2026-08-04 - CLAUDE.md rebuilt as the project's durable record
The previous version claimed only the splash, room creation, join flow, and lobby were implemented.
In reality the full game loop, leaderboards, end-of-game rankings, player accounts, and lobby reconnect were all already built, which forced a full re-inspection of the codebase.
Replaced with complete collection, publication, method, route, and defect tables plus this log.
